The in-progress replacement Android App for the Gorilla Groove project located here: https://github.com/AyrtonStout/gorilla-groove

**[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxzaTOIZXOA&feature=youtu.be)**

This Application requires Gorilla Groove login credentials. The goal of the app is to stream audio from a backend server to an Android device for music on the go.
